# Reflection for CS 320 Portfolio Submission

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**  
I ensure my code is functional by writing clear unit tests using JUnit. I validate both positive and negative test cases to confirm the application behaves correctly and handles errors. To ensure security, I validate all inputs like checking for null values, proper length and format. This helps prevent issues like invalid or malicious data from being processed.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**  
I interpret user needs by carefully reviewing the project requirements and translating them into specific features and validations. For example, when the requirement stated that a contactâ€™s phone number must be exactly 10 digits, I added strict validation to enforce this rule and wrote unit tests to make sure incorrect inputs were rejected.

**How do I approach designing software?**  
I approach software design by breaking down the problem into smaller parts. I design each part (class or service) to handle one responsibility at a time. I also focus on making the code easy to test, maintain and extend. I focus on organizing my code with data encapsulation, strong input checks and clear naming to make the software easy to read and maintain.
